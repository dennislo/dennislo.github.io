## [ðŸ’» Development](#development)

### [Running locally](#running-locally)

1. **Run server**

   Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-site/
    npm run develop
    ```

2. **Open the code and start customizing!**

   Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000

   For example, you can edit `src/pages/index.tsx` to see your site update in real-time.

### [Making changes](#making-changes)

All edits to be committed to the `develop` branch. Creating features branches
is useful for larger changes.

## [ðŸš€ Deployment](#deployment)

### [Deploying latest](#deploying-latest)

**NOTE:** Do not commit directly to the `master` branch
as this is the production branch for github pages.

Run the following to deploy the latest changes to production:

```shell
git checkout develop
npm run deploy
```

Your site will be built and deployed using the latest `master` branch. This is served by GitHub Pages at https://dlo.wtf/
